Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

It pairs with natural skin soothers and refiners to renew your complexion as you sleep. Glycerin, a natural moisture magnet, blends with essential fatty acids found naturally in our skin to restore skin's moisture levelsand a glowing complexion. Silicon is a hydrator that helps rebuild skin as it smooths and fills the fine lines that come with dryness. Sweet Birch and Clove Oil both aid skin repair: the first as a mild exfoliator that boosts cell renewal; the last by eliminating oil and bacteria while calming irritation. Our Phelityl Night Cream contains concentrates of natural raw materials and extracts. Due to the nature of these actives, each batch can vary from time to time with slight variations in color, texture and scent. When first produced Phelityl Night Cream, like tofu, has a soft and silky appearance, and over time it cures, producing a more bouncy texture.

The description of item_466 is: ['Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Moisturizing and Nourishing formula, softens even the thickest and coarsest beards, allowing the blade to glide easily and making the beard easier to shave. This formula is made using Proraso\'s signature "hot soap" process, resulting in a very rich soap that produces a superior lather. Enriched with Sandalwood Oil for it\'s calming and soothing effect, and Shea Butter to keep skin soft and supple, skin is left moisturized and nourished, protected from razor burn, and with the warm, woodsy scent of Sandalwood. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.', 'Proraso has been transforming shaving into a pleasurable experience for decades. The distinctive quality and performance of Proraso products has made them a staple in barbershops throughout Italy.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/fef5d962-8b88-4755-b586-889bee4b22cd._SL220__.png">', '<a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/d4675cab-c294-4fc4-93cb-563c3defd127.jpg">\n            <img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/d4675cab-c294-4fc4-93cb-563c3defd127._SL220__.jpg">\n        </a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        <div class="a-text-center">\n            <a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/d4675cab-c294-4fc4-93cb-563c3defd127.jpg">\n                View larger\n            </a>\n        </div>', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/c8059d31-3ead-4f9e-ad89-c6b9815cda6e._SL220__.png">', '<a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/4fd9b083-34da-4f75-be25-01feb0e0ae21.jpg">\n            <img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/4fd9b083-34da-4f75-be25-01feb0e0ae21._SL220__.jpg">\n        </a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        <div class="a-text-center">\n            <a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/4fd9b083-34da-4f75-be25-01feb0e0ae21.jpg">\n                View larger\n            </a>\n        </div>', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/66dcdadf-63b5-4444-a51a-57035e75868c._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/907b496e-c657-44ac-b5f9-02bdd2266bfc._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/26f46b2b-84c5-4618-994f-50dfcb313812._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/1a88478d-9570-41b5-8080-13631a9c8740._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/1fe2bccc-e9b7-4398-891a-c0f81eeb37b4._SL220__.jpg">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/d7e14f4c-f919-4715-b67f-3a8d781e6311._SL220__.png">', '<a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/0c19321c-35bc-4cfc-85d8-b37272d15b1c.png">\n            <img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/0c19321c-35bc-4cfc-85d8-b37272d15b1c._SL220__.png">\n        </a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        <div class="a-text-center">\n            <a class="a-link-normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/0c19321c-35bc-4cfc-85d8-b37272d15b1c.png">\n                View larger\n            </a>\n        </div>', '']
